# Chess
The goal of this project is to create a command line chess game in Ruby, where 2 players can play against each other.

## Criteria:
1. The game should be properly constrained â€“ it should prevent players from making illegal moves and declare check or check mate in the correct situations.
2. You should be able to save the board at any time.
